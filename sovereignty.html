                    A fundamental concept in political science and international law, referring to the supreme authority within a territory. It denotes the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. Sovereignty involves both internal and external dimensions: internally, it means the state has ultimate authority over its affairs, laws, and governance; externally, it implies independence from other states and external powers</span>

                        <p class="urbanist-font paragraph">refers to a symbolic ruler who holds a ceremonial position without actual governing power. Such sovereigns are often seen in constitutional monarchies where the monarch's role is largely ceremonial, serving as a symbol of unity and tradition but without significant political power. Examples include the Queen of Britain, the King of Japan, and the President of India</p>

                            <span class="syne-font">Internal Sovereignty</span> denotes the supreme authority of the state to govern its affairs within its territorial boundaries. It involves the state's ability to exercise ultimate power over individuals, groups, and institutions, ensuring compliance with its laws. This aspect of sovereignty is critical for maintaining order and implementing laws within the state.

                            <span class="syne-font">External Sovereignty</span> refers to the state's independence from external control and its capacity to engage in international relations. It means the state is free from the influence of other states and can conduct its foreign affairs autonomously. This includes establishing diplomatic relations, determining foreign policies, and seeking help from international organizations like the United Nations in case of external aggression.</p>
