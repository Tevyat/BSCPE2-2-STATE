                <p>Bluntschli believes that force is an essential 
                    component of the state's structure. During the two World Wars, Great Britain defended its territory. Only military might may be used to combat Nazi armies. Furthermore, Russian military strength halted German soldiers' onslaught.</p>
                <p>According to this idea, strong tribes' battles and aggressions had a significant role in the formation of the state. The saying "war begot the King'' is often used to explain the history of the state. In early civilization, force or strength took precedence over right. A physically stronger person can establish dominance over weaker others. The tribe's strongest member is designated as its chief or leader.</p>
