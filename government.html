                <p class="urbanist-font paragraph">The Government is the organization or machinery or agency or magistracy of the State which makes, implements, enforces and adjudicates the laws of the state. Government is the third essential element of the State. The state exercises its sovereign power through its government.
                    <br><br>This sometimes creates the impression that there is no difference between the State and Government. However it must be clearly noted that government is just one element of the State. It is the agent or the working agency of the State. Sovereignty belongs to the State; the government only uses it on behalf of the State.

                <p class="urbanist-font paragraph">The Philippines is a republic with a presidential form of government wherein power is equally divided among its three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.
                    <br><br>One basic corollary in a presidential system of government is the principle of separation of powers wherein legislation belongs to Congress, execution to the executive, and settlement of legal controversies to the judiciary.

                        <h1 class="theory-text-2 syne-font syne-hollow">Judiciary</h1>
                        <p class="urbanist-font paragraph">The Judicial branch holds the power to settle controversies involving rights that are legally enforceable. It determines whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess jurisdiction on the instrumentality of the government. It is made up of the Supreme and lower courts.

            <div class="scroll-wrapper" id="explain-gradient">
                <p class="urbanist-font paragraph">The Constitution expressly grants the Supreme Court the power of Judicial Review as the power to declare a treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance or regulation unconstitutional. The Government as a whole is the instrument through which the sovereign power of the State gets used.
                    <br><br>In ancient times, the King used to perform all functions of the government and all powers of governance stood centralized in his hands. Gradually, however, the powers of the King got decentralized and these came to be exercised by these three organs of the government: Legislature, Executive and Judiciary.
                    <br><br>Each of these three organs of the government carries out its assigned functions. Independence of Judiciary is also a settled rule. The relationship between the Legislature and Executive is defined by law and it corresponds to the adopted form of government. In a Parliamentary form of government, like the one which is working in India and Britain, the legislature and executive are closely related and the latter is collectively responsible before the former.
                    <br><br>In the Presidential form, as is in operation in the U.S.A., the legislature and executive are two independent and separate organs with stable and fixed tenures, and the executive is not responsible to the legislature. It is directly responsible to the people.
                    <br><br>Government is an essential element of the State. However it keeps on changing after regular intervals. Further, Government can be of any form—Monarchy or Aristocracy or Dictatorship or Democracy. It can be either Parliamentary or Presidential or both. It can be Unitary or Federal or of mixture of these two in its organisation and working. In contemporary times every civilized State has a democratic representative, responsible transparent and accountable government.
