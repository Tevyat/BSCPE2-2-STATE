                <p class="urbanist-font paragraph">The Government is the organization or machinery or agency or magistracy of the State which makes, implements, enforces and adjudicates the laws of the state. Government is the third essential element of the State. The state exercises its sovereign power through its government.
                    <br><br>This sometimes creates the impression that there is no difference between the State and Government. However it must be clearly noted that government is just one element of the State. It is the agent or the working agency of the State. Sovereignty belongs to the State; the government only uses it on behalf of the State.

                <p class="urbanist-font paragraph">The Philippines is a republic with a presidential form of government wherein power is equally divided among its three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.
                    <br><br>One basic corollary in a presidential system of government is the principle of separation of powers wherein legislation belongs to Congress, execution to the executive, and settlement of legal controversies to the judiciary.

It determines whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess jurisdiction on the instrumentality of the government. It is made up of the Supreme and lower courts.
