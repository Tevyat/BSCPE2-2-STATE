                                "war begot the King'' is often used to explain the history of the 
                                state. In early civilization, force or strength took precedence over 
                                right. A physically stronger person can establish dominance over weaker
                                others. The tribe's strongest member is designated as its chief or leader.</p>

                    It is crucial to recognize that a state's growth and development rely heavily on the government's approach 
                    to leadership, authority, and control. Many nations, particularly in Africa and specifically Nigeria, have 
                    faced significant developmental challenges due to poor governance. Since its inception, Nigeria has struggled 
                    with establishing a good, credible, and accountable government. The pursuit of good governance is seen as Nigeria's 
                    most pressing need. Many Nigerians firmly believe that poor leadership and bad governance have hindered the country's progress 
                    in nearly every area of human endeavor. (Nnamdi, 2009). Nigeria as a nation has produced leaders, who practically have nothing 
                    in mind to offer for the nation and her citizens, but to just become leaders, over the years. This is supported by

                </p>
                <p class="urbanist-font2 six">
                    Social Contract Theory has its foundations in old Greece, beginning with Socrates, who recommended that people willfully go into a common agreement to make an equitable and moral society. The idea acquired huge consideration in the 17th century  through the work of Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes contended that without an overseeing authority, individuals would live in a condition of consistent trepidation and viciousness. To get away from this, they enthusiastically surrender specific freedoms to a sovereign ruler in return for protection and security.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    John Locke, additionally in the 17th century, developed this thought by underscoring individual privileges. He contended that the social contract's purpose is to safeguard these rights, and assuming that an administration neglects to do as such, individuals reserve the privilege to renegade and form another administration.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the 18th century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau presented the idea of the "general will." He trusted that for a general public to be just, choices ought to be made on the whole considering the benefit of all, as opposed to individual interests.

                    What is the Social<br>Contract Theory
                </p>
                <p class="urbanist-font2 six">
                    Social Contract Theory, a principal part of political way of thinking, investigates the perplexing connection among people and societal structures. The central reason of this hypothesis is that society's individuals certainly consent to surrender a few freedoms to authorities in return for the security of their excess freedoms. Promoters of Social Contract Theory explore the beginnings of moral and political order, focusing on how aggregate arrangements impact human existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The hypothesis' starting points lie in the Enlightenment era, where philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau thought about the human condition in a 'state of nature' — a speculative reality without political foundations. They contended that judicious people would agree to form a society governed by shared commitments, creating some distance from the solitary, harsh life characteristic of the state of nature. This shift is driven by an innate comprehension of moral standards and natural laws.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the 20th century, John Rawls revived the hypothesis with his theory of justice,' reconsidering the social contract as a fair agreement among equals. Rawls underscored the job of moral people in making a fair society where political power is utilized to support all, especially the least advantaged. His thoughts have huge significance in contemporary conversations on value and reasonableness in educational and political organizations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Social Contract Theory gives a system to figuring out the development of societal standards and the harmony between individual freedom and the collective good. It stays a prevailing hypothesis for investigating the philosophical groundworks of present day administration and social structures.

                    Thomas Hobbes was one of the earliest to investigate social contract theory. In his work Leviathan, Hobbes contended that people normally exist in a turbulent and self-intrigued state, known as the state of nature. He declared that people go into a common agreement to lay out a sovereign ruler, giving up specific freedoms in return for security and order.

                <p class="urbanist-font2 seven">
                    John Locke gave a differentiating perspective. He set that people have basic privileges, like life, freedom, and property. As per Locke, the basic role of government is to safeguard these privileges, and in the event that it fails, people reserve the option to rebel.

                    Jean-Jacques Rousseau presented an alternate translation, focusing in the idea of the collective will. Rousseau accepted that society undermines people and that genuine freedom must be accomplished through direct democracy, where residents settle on choices collectively.

                <p class="urbanist-font2 seven">
                    Immanuel Kant further fostered these hypotheses, accentuating the ethical element of social contract theory. He contended that people ought to act as indicated by widespread moral rules that can be legitimate through reason.
