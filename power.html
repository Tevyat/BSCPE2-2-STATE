                <p class="theory-text-2 urbanist-font paragraph hidden2"><br><br><br>The police power in the Philippines refers to the plenary power vested in the legislature to make laws, statutes, and ordinances that promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order, safety, and general welfare of the people. This power is exercised by various entities, including the Philippine Congress, the President, executive agencies, and local government units like the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Manila. 
                    <br><br>The President can directly perform functions conferred upon agencies like the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) under the police power, as it falls within the President's power of control over executive departments. Delegated powers to agencies like the DOTC to establish and administer programs are considered part of the nature of police power, aimed at promoting the welfare of the people.

                    <li>Constitutional limitations: The exercise of police power must not violate the rights guaranteed by the Philippine Constitution, such as due process, equal protection, and freedom of speech.</li>
                    
                    <li>Reasonable relationship to a legitimate public purpose: The exercise of police power must be reasonably necessary and appropriate for achieving a legitimate public purpose, such as protecting public health, safety, or welfare.</li>
                    
                    <li>>Non-arbitrary and non-oppressive: The measures taken under the police power must not be unfair, oppressive, partial, or discriminatory.</li>

                <p class="theory-text-2 urbanist-font paragraph hidden2"><br><br>The Lifeblood Theory of taxation asserts that taxation is the lifeblood of government, essential for its existence and functioning. This theory underscores the crucial role of taxation in funding governmental activities and ensuring the provision of public goods and services.
                    <br><br>Meanwhile, the Doctrine of Necessity maintains that the power to tax is an inherent attribute of sovereignty, crucial for the state's survival and effective governance. This doctrine emphasizes the necessity of taxation to meet the financial needs of the government when necessary for the welfare and survival of the state, particularly during crises or emergencies.
                    <br><br>It recognizes that there are situations where the government must act in the public interest, even if it means exceeding its ordinary powers or bypassing legal procedures.

                    BASIC PRINCIPLE OF<br> A SOUND TAX SYSTEM
                </h1>
                <p class="theory-text-2 urbanist-font paragraph hidden2"><br><br><br>The basic principle of a sound tax system is to achieve fairness, efficiency, simplicity, and adequacy (Bird & Zolt, 2019). A fair tax system ensures that taxes are imposed equitably, taking into account taxpayers' ability to pay and distributing the tax burden fairly across different income levels. An efficient tax system minimizes administrative costs and economic distortions while maximizing revenue collection. Simplicity in tax laws and procedures reduces compliance costs and improves taxpayer compliance. Adequacy ensures that tax revenues are sufficient to meet the government's expenditure requirements without resorting to excessive borrowing or deficit financing.</p>
