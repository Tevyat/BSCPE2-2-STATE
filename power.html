                <p class="theory-text-2 urbanist-font paragraph hidden2"><br><br><br>The police power in the Philippines refers to the plenary power vested in the legislature to make laws, statutes, and ordinances that promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order, safety, and general welfare of the people. This power is exercised by various entities, including the Philippine Congress, the President, executive agencies, and local government units like the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Manila. 
                    <br><br>The President can directly perform functions conferred upon agencies like the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) under the police power, as it falls within the President's power of control over executive departments. Delegated powers to agencies like the DOTC to establish and administer programs are considered part of the nature of police power, aimed at promoting the welfare of the people.

                <p class="theory-text-2 urbanist-font paragraph hidden2"><br>The police power of the state in the Philippines is subject to several limitations:
                    <ul class="theory-text-2 urbanist-font paragraph hidden2">
                    <li>Constitutional limitations: The exercise of police power must not violate the rights guaranteed by the Philippine Constitution, such as due process, equal protection, and freedom of speech.</li>
                    
                    <li>Reasonable relationship to a legitimate public purpose: The exercise of police power must be reasonably necessary and appropriate for achieving a legitimate public purpose, such as protecting public health, safety, or welfare.</li>
                    
                    <li>>Non-arbitrary and non-oppressive: The measures taken under the police power must not be unfair, oppressive, partial, or discriminatory.</li>
                    
                    <li>Consistency with public policy: Police power regulations must be general and consistent with public policy.</li>
                    
                    <li>Reasonableness: The exercise of police power must be reasonable and not prohibit, but may regulate, trade.</li>
                    
                    <li>Conformity with procedure: Police power regulations must be passed according to the procedure prescribed by law.</li></ul></p>
            </div>

            <div class="scroll-wrapper img-court">
                <p class="theory-text-2 urbanist-font paragraph hidden2"><br><br>The Philippine Supreme Court plays a crucial role in interpreting the scope and limitations of the police power, ensuring that it is exercised within constitutional boundaries while balancing the state's interest in protecting public welfare with the rights of individuals and businesses.
                    <br><br>The exercise of police power must not contravene the Constitution or any statute, be unfair or oppressive, be partial or discriminatory, prohibit but may regulate trade, be general and consistent with public policy, and must not be unreasonable. The City of Manila, for instance, has the power to enact ordinances under its police power, ensuring the general welfare of its inhabitants in line with the principle that the welfare of the people is the supreme law.
                    <br><br>Overall, the police power in the Philippines is a broad authority aimed at promoting public welfare and maintaining order, subject to constitutional limitations and the requirement that its exercise be reasonable, fair, and in the best interest of the community.
